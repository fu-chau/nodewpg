// Copy and paste the code from exercise 49
// Refactor the code so it match the new requirements:
// If firstNumber variable is bigger than secondNumber then show the following message: Number %firstNumber% is bigger than %secondNumber%
// Else show Number %secondNumber% is bigger than %firstNumber%
