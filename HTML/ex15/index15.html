        <p>A follow-up to the 2008 cult horror hit “The Strangers,” “The Strangers: Prey at Night” isn’t really a sequel, at least not in the generally accepted sense of the word. Rather than advancing the story – about a couple who is terrorized by three masked assailants wielding knives and an ax – “Prey at Night” merely repeats that winning formula, swapping out the first film’s victims, played by Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman, for two new characters.</p>
        
        <p>“Characters” is such a strong word.</p>
        
        <p>Teenage Luke (Lewis Pullman) and his younger sister, Kinsey (Bailee Madison), aren’t so much people as pawns, fresh meat that just keeps getting pushed around an increasingly blood-soaked chessboard – here, an empty, dimly lit trailer park, just off the exit for Godforsaken Nowhere. During a stopover with their parents on the way to drop Kinsey off at boarding school, they’re stalked by the same trio of theatrical psychopaths we met 10 years ago: two young women in Halloween masks, known as Dollface and Pinup Girl (Emma Bellomy and Lea Enslin, respectively), and a man (Damian Maffei) with a burlap sack over his head, emblazoned with a crude, scarecrow face. (He’s identified in the credits, less poetically, as the Man in the Mask.) Mom and Dad, played by Christina Hendricks and Martin Henderson, get dispatched fairly quickly, along with some vague, never-specified backstory about Kinsey’s troubled past.</p>
        
        <p>You’ve got to give credit to Bryan Bertino, who wrote and directed the first film on a shoestring budget of $9 million, and who co-wrote this one (with Ben Ketai) before handing the reins to director Johannes Roberts (“47 Meters Down”). At least he sticks to the filmmaking mantra that has guided so many horror auteurs before him: Keep it simple, stupid. You won’t get any bells and whistles here.</p>
